# pi-cyber-ui

A standalone Pi package that bundles a cyber-inspired editor, compact footer, lightweight working indicator, optional compact tool rendering, and a matching dark theme.

The visual direction was inspired by Tokyo Night, but this is a new project with its own palette, naming, and packaging structure.

The extension is split into small modules for easier maintenance:
- `editor.ts` wires editor/session events
- `cyber-editor.ts` owns the prompt shell, prompt marker, dynamic border, and optional session name label
- `editor-state.ts` handles session state and token accounting
- `working.ts` renders prompt progress and idle summaries
- `footer.ts` renders cwd, git dirty state, model, thinking level, and context usage
- `profile.ts` resolves `native`/`full`, registers `/cyber-profile`, and persists the global user profile
- `tool-render.ts` re-registers built-in tools with compact cyber renderers while delegating execution to Pi built-ins; activated only in `full` profile
- `read-compact.ts` preserves Pi read compact compatibility for skills and agent resource files in `full` profile
- `tool-registry.ts` tracks tool lifecycle, durations, and per-turn tallies in `full` profile
- `path-utils.ts` contains shared path shortening/styling helpers
- `token-usage.ts` contains protocol-aware exact/estimated token helpers

## Local development

```bash
cd ~/Developer/pi-cyber-ui
npm install
npm run typecheck
```

## Using with Pi

Install from the remote repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/22GNUs/pi-cyber-ui.git
```

For local development, you can also install from a local checkout path:

```bash
pi install /path/to/pi-cyber-ui
```

The package is structured to be publishable later via git or npm without changing the directory layout.

### Profiles

`pi-cyber-ui` defaults to the low-intrusion `native` profile:

```bash
pi
```

Switch profiles with the built-in command:

```text
/cyber-profile native
/cyber-profile full
/cyber-profile toggle
/cyber-profile status
```

The command persists the choice globally to `~/.pi/agent/pi-cyber-ui.json` and automatically reloads Pi so the new profile takes effect.

You can also use an environment variable as a temporary override:

```bash
PI_CYBER_UI_PROFILE=full pi
```

Available profiles:

| Profile | Default | Tool overrides | Use case |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `native` | ✅ | none | Keeps Pi native tool definitions/renderers for maximum compatibility with Pi defaults and other extensions. Keeps theme, editor, footer, and working indicator. Tool colors come from theme tokens only. |
| `full` | — | `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` | Enables compact tool rows, Nerd Font tool icons, per-tool header colors, summaries, durations, and compact read affordances. May conflict with other extensions that register the same tool names. |

Enable the full compact tool rendering explicitly:

```text
/cyber-profile full
```

Unknown persisted or environment profile values fall back to `native`. If `PI_CYBER_UI_PROFILE` is set by your shell, it overrides the persisted config on future launches.

When it is published, install it with one of these forms:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-cyber-ui
# or
pi install git:github.com/22GNUs/pi-cyber-ui.git
```

## Architecture contract

This package is not a full tool implementation fork. Tool rendering is profile-gated progressive enhancement.

In the default `native` profile, `pi-cyber-ui` does not re-register any Pi built-in tools. This preserves Pi native tool definitions/renderers and avoids conflicts with other extensions. Tool-level coloring is limited to theme tokens such as `toolTitle`, `toolOutput`, `toolPendingBg`, `toolSuccessBg`, `toolErrorBg`, and diff colors.

In the explicit `full` profile, built-in tools are re-registered to control the UI, but execution and prompt metadata continue to come from Pi's native tool definitions.

- Inherited from Pi native tools in `full`: `execute`, parameter schemas, descriptions, prompt snippets, and prompt guidelines.
- Customized by this package in `full`: `renderCall`, `renderResult`, compact summaries, duration/spinner display, and cyber color semantics.
- Consequence: Pi execution-layer improvements usually apply automatically; Pi native renderer improvements do not. Renderer-specific features must be reviewed and ported when Pi changes.
- Compatibility rule: preserve known Pi compact read affordances where they affect semantics, especially `SKILL.md` as `[skill] name` and agent resource files (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`) as compact resource reads.
- Maintenance rule: after upgrading `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, review Pi's built-in renderers, especially `core/tools/read`, before publishing.

## Commands

- `/cyber-profile [native|full|toggle|status]` — show or switch the global `pi-cyber-ui` profile. Changes are persisted and followed by an automatic reload.
- Pi's built-in `/name <name>` sets the session display name. When present, `pi-cyber-ui` shows it in the editor's top-right border as `⟦ name ⟧`.

## Notes

- Package name: `pi-cyber-ui`
- Theme name: `cyber-ui-dark`
- Extension entrypoint: `extensions/pi-cyber-ui/index.ts`
- Exact streaming usage is protocol-aware; Anthropic Messages API can surface cumulative in-flight usage, while other APIs fall back to estimates
- Working indicator uses Pi's official `ctx.ui.setWorkingIndicator()` / `ctx.ui.setWorkingMessage()` APIs
- Default profile is `native`, which does not re-register built-in tools
- Use `/cyber-profile full` or `PI_CYBER_UI_PROFILE=full` to re-register built-in tools for compact rendering while preserving their original execution behavior and prompt metadata
- Theme format follows the official Pi theme schema
